🍽️ Active digestion and nutrient absorption period
🩸 Elevated blood glucose and insulin levels
⚡ Body stores energy in muscles and liver as glycogen
🏋️ Excess carbohydrates are converted to fats
🔄 Active tissue recovery and growth processes
💪 Optimal time for mass training
";

// Catabolic Phase Description
"phase.description.catabolic" = "
📉 Glucose and insulin levels decrease
🔋 Body starts using glycogen reserves
⚖️ Breakdown processes activate
🧪 Glucagon production begins - a hormone that promotes glycogen breakdown
🔄 Body gradually transitions to using fat reserves
🏃 Good time for cardio training
";

// Fat Burning Phase Description
"phase.description.fatBurning" = "
📪 Glycogen stores are depleted
🔥 Body switches to using fat reserves as main energy source
⚗️ Ketone bodies are actively produced
📉 Insulin levels drop to minimum
🧹 Autophagy processes activate (cell cleansing)
📈 Growth hormone production increases
✨ Insulin sensitivity improves
🔥 Active fat burning occurs
💪 Optimal time for fat burning workouts
